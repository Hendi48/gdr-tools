For example, to flash an 8163B connected as the secondary slave with the 8050L 
firmware from 8050L.dld:

SF8163 8050L.dld 3 /f /c /p /o

one or more of the "disable xxx" switches may not be needed, depending on the 
firmware already installed on the drive. If you get a message saying there is no 
CD/DVD drive, try the /r switch, but make sure you have specified the correct 
drive first and maybe use the /i switch so you get one last chance to confirm it.
